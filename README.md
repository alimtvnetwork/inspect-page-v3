## Install

### Chrome Extension (Load Unpacked)

1. Download [`public/inspect-page.zip`](public/inspect-page.zip) and unzip it.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome (or any Chromium browser: Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera).
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped folder.

### WordPress Plugin (Smart Share backend)

1. Download [`public/inspect-page-wp.zip`](public/inspect-page-wp.zip).
2. In your WP admin, go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
3. Choose the zip, install, then **Activate**.
4. Go to **Tools → Inspect Page** to confirm REST + permalinks are healthy.

> The WordPress site URL is baked into the extension at build time via the `INSPECT_PAGE_WP_SITE_URL` constant. Production must set this before publishing to the Chrome Web Store.

## About Inspect Page

Inspect Page started from one frustrating loop: paste a screenshot into an LLM, then re-paste the HTML, then the CSS, then a missing font, then realize the colors are off because the screenshot was compressed. Every "look at this page and help me redesign it" prompt was a chore.

So the extension does that whole bundle in one click. It captures the rendered page (or a single element), extracts the HTML, the cascaded CSS, the inline JS, the actual color tokens (tint/base/shade), the fonts that were really used, and a full-page screenshot — then hands the LLM a single Markdown file (or a zip, or four short shareable URLs) with everything in the right place and a ready-to-paste AI instruction block on top.

It is Manifest V3, dark-mint themed, and the in-page floating panel is pinned to a stable 412×820 visual size on every site and every Chrome zoom level.

## Features (in detail)

### Capture modes

- **Full Page** — entire document, stitched screenshot, full DOM + CSSOM.
- **Element** — click a single element in the floating inspector; the export bundles just that subtree and its computed styles.
- **Inspect tab** — live snapshot of the current page: tag counts, colors, fonts, computed metrics. Refresh with ↻.

### Export modes

| Mode | Output | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **MD single** | One `.md` file with a base64-inlined screenshot. | Drag into ChatGPT / Claude in one drop. |
| **MD + files** | `.zip` containing `prompt.md` plus assets as separate files. | LLM tools that prefer real files over base64. |
| **ZIP** | Full bundle with `prompt.md`, `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `tokens.css`, `selectors.css`, `preview.png`. | Local archival, handoff to a designer. |
| **Smart Share** *(Pro / WP plugin)* | Uploads to the user's own WordPress site and returns 4 short public URLs valid for 24h, plus the AI instruction block. | Pasting into a chat window without attachments. |

From the Inspect tab, the **Export report** dropdown can also emit standalone artifacts via real Chrome downloads with a Save As prompt: JSON snapshot, Markdown report, Colors CSV, Fonts CSV.

### Color Tokens v2

Each detected color is broken into **tint / base / shade** variants and written to `tokens.css`. Per-selector custom CSS rules are emitted to `selectors.css` so the LLM sees both the design system *and* where it was applied.

### Smart Share auth

Standard WordPress login cookie + `X-WP-Nonce`. **No** pairing tokens, **no** Application Passwords. Sign-in opens the hidden `inspect-page-bridge` admin page and the bridge sends a `wp_rest` nonce back to the extension via `postMessage`.

Per-WP-user limits: **30** active sessions, **60** uploads/hour, lifetime free quota of **5** Smart Shares. Beyond that the popup shows an inline **Upgrade to Pro** CTA that opens Stripe Checkout. Pro users get unlimited shares and the "Manage subscription" button (Stripe Customer Portal). The popup tagline ("$X / month") is rendered dynamically from Stripe via the WP `/billing/status` endpoint (cached 12h).

### WP plugin dashboard

- **Account** — license status, email, plan.
- **Pairing** — extension health, REST + permalinks check.
- **Live quotas** — uploads/hour, active sessions, lifetime shares used.
- **Tools → Sessions** — sortable list with JS column, expiry countdown, and a "Recent visitors" drawer (Pro, opt-in).

### Popup & floating panel UX

- **Settings** opens as a full popup overlay (no peeking export UI behind it) with a native-styled dark `<select>` chevron.
- **Inspect** tab paints a shimmer skeleton on first frame, then fills in the snapshot asynchronously via `requestIdleCallback`. Subsequent opens paint instantly from a module-scoped cache.
- **Recent Shares** rows show a 36×36 preview thumbnail and a `👁 N` badge that expands to a per-file breakdown + last-viewed timestamp.
- **In-page floating panel** is locked to a 412×820 visual size on every site and every Chrome zoom level via `chrome.tabs.getZoom` compensation.
- **Theme** is dark-mint (`#0B0F0E` / `#2DD4A8` → `#73FFB8`) across both popup and floating panel.

## Build & package

```bash
# Build + zip the Chrome extension → public/inspect-page.zip
cd extension && bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run build && bun run package

# Build + zip the WP plugin → public/inspect-page-wp.zip
bash scripts/package-wp.sh

# Build both in one go
bash scripts/release.sh

# Run CI validators locally (brand, versions, zip freshness, axios)
for s in scripts/ci/check-*.mjs; do node "$s"; done
```

The `zip` CLI must be on `PATH`. CI installs it via `apt-get install -y zip` before packaging.
