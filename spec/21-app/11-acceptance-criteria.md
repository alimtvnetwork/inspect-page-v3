# 11 — Acceptance criteria (executable checklist)

Each item references a test ID in `22-test-plan.md`. An AC is satisfied iff the referenced test(s) pass.

## A. Full Page Export
- [ ] AC-FP-1 — Clicking "Export Full Page" produces a `.zip`. (T1)
- [ ] AC-FP-2 — `page.html` opens standalone and renders. (T1)
- [ ] AC-FP-3 — `styles.css` contains all readable stylesheet rules with `/* === <source> === */` headers. (T1, T2)
- [ ] AC-FP-4 — `scripts.js` contains all readable scripts with source headers. (T1, T2)
- [ ] AC-FP-5 — `screenshot.png` covers the full page (height ≈ `pageCssPx.h * dpr`). (T2)
- [ ] AC-FP-6 — Sticky/fixed elements are not ghosted across frames. (T3)
- [ ] AC-FP-7 — `manifest.json` matches the schema in `17-file-formats.md`. (T1)
- [ ] AC-FP-8 — Bundle deterministic except for `capturedAtIso` and pixel diffs from animation. (T14)

## B. Element Export
- [ ] AC-EL-1 — Picker mode highlights hovered elements with a tooltip. (T4)
- [ ] AC-EL-2 — Right-click on highlighted element triggers export and suppresses page handlers. (T7)
- [ ] AC-EL-3 — `.md` contains outerHTML, matched CSS, computed styles, two Base64 screenshots. (T4, T5)
- [ ] AC-EL-4 — `.md` is ≤ `MD_FILE_MAX_BYTES`; truncation note added if degraded. (T5)
- [ ] AC-EL-5 — Escape cancels picker without downloading. (T6)

## C. UI / Flow
- [ ] AC-UI-1 — Popup available on all normal pages; disabled with tooltip on `chrome://`, `data:`, `about:`. (T9)
- [ ] AC-UI-2 — Floating panel can be mounted from popup and dragged within viewport. (T12)
- [ ] AC-UI-3 — Panel position and settings persist across reloads. (T11, T12)
- [ ] AC-UI-4 — Errors surface in panel with code, message, and Copy details. (T10)
- [ ] AC-UI-5 — Keyboard shortcuts trigger exports. (T15)
- [ ] AC-UI-6 — Reduced motion respected. (T16)

## D. Robustness
- [ ] AC-RB-1 — SPA route change mid-export aborts cleanly and restores page state. (T8)
- [ ] AC-RB-2 — Pages exceeding canvas limits fail with `E_PAGE_TOO_LARGE` and no partial file. (T10)
- [ ] AC-RB-3 — Password fields redacted by default in `page.html`. (T13)

## E. Build / Distribution
- [ ] AC-BD-1 — `bun run lint` and `bun run test` both exit 0. (T18)
- [ ] AC-BD-2 — `bun run package` produces `public/llm-export.zip` ≤ `1.5 MiB` with sidecar `.sha256`. (T17)
- [ ] AC-BD-3 — `chrome://extensions` → Load unpacked succeeds with zero warnings.
- [ ] AC-BD-4 — Lovable landing page downloads the ZIP via fetch+blob. (manual: visit `/`, click Download.)

## F. Spec completeness
- [ ] AC-SP-1 — Every `MessageKind` in code has a matching entry in `15-message-contracts.md`.
- [ ] AC-SP-2 — Every numeric constant in code is declared in `20-performance-budgets.md`.
- [ ] AC-SP-3 — Every error code thrown by code appears in the `09-error-handling.md` catalog.

A release is shippable iff every box above is checked.
